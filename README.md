# star_wars_planetary_guide

This web application pulls data from the Star Wars API (http://swapi.co/api/planets/) and displays it in a table. The table is responsive and resizes to fit browser window sizes and mobile/tablet screens. On desktop mode, table column headings are sortable by clicking.

### To run the app

- download this repo and run "npm install" in the main directory
- run the command "npm start" in the main directory
- go to http://localhost:3000/

All script files have been bundled using Webpack into a single script file, bundle.js


### Other notes

- This project was completed part-way through my studies at CodeClan, prior to learning front-end frameworks. It is my intention to revisit this project and rebuild using React or similar JS framework.
